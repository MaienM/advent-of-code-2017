= Advent of Code 2017

== Setup

To get all dependencies, run:

----
cabal sandbox init
cabal install --only-dependencies --enable-tests
----

== Tests

To run all tests and get terse output, run:

----
cabal test
----

To get more detailed output, run:

----
./scripts/test.sh
----

To run only the tests for a specific module, pass the name as a parameter:

----
./scripts/test.sh Common
----

== Output

Put the input files in a folder named `input`. Each file name should be in the same format as the module names, ending
with `.txt` (`AOC01.txt`, etc.).

To run the code for a given day, run:

----
./scripts/run.sh 01
----

This will output two lines, which are the answers for part one and two.
